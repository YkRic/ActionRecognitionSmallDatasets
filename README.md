## Abstract

Action recognition is the computer vision task of identifying what action is happening in a given sequence of frames. Traditional approaches rely on handcrafted features and domain-specific image processing algorithms, often resulting in limited accuracy. The substantial advances in deep learning and the availability of larger datasets have allowed techniques that yield much better performance without domain-specific knowledge to recognize actions being performed based on the raw information from video sequences, a strategy called *representation learning*. However, deep neural networks usually require very large labeled datasets for training and properly generalizing, and due to their high capacity, they often overfit small data, hence providing suboptimal results. This work aims to check the real feasibility of employing deep learning in the context of small-sized action recognition datasets. Our goal is to verify whether deep learning approaches can provide improved performance in cases in which labeled data is not abundant. In order to do so, we perform a thorough empirical analysis in which we investigate distinct network architectures with hyperparameter optimization, as well as different data pre-processing techniques and fusion methods.

## Models

In this work we test serveral deep networks configurations. Each network is described below:

**VGG16**: The VGG networks [1](#references) developed by the  Visual Geometry Group (VGG) from Oxford contains 16 weight layers divided in groups of convolutions using 3x3 filters in each convolutional layer.  
**Inception-v3**: Google's Inception-V3 [2] (hereafter called V3) is a 48-layers deep Convolutional Neural Network based on *inception* modules that contain convolutional filters with a number of different dimensionalities running in parallel, covering different clusters of information.  
**Two-Stream Network**: Proposed by Simonyan and Zisserman [3], the network computes two separated recognition streams (a spatial containing still images and a temporal containing the motion performed in a sequence of images). Both networks are merged by late fusion, where the prediction scores are combined by concatenation or by the mean.  
The configuration of each network and the names we adopted in the paper are presented as follows:

## Experiments

In this work we analyze the performance of algorithms for action recognition using deep learning in small datasets (ranging from a few thousand videos to hundreds of thousands). Each selected dataset differs from others by means of characteristics such as images recorded with a static/dynamic camera, egocentric/third-person view of the camera, *etc*.

### DogCentric dataset

The DogCentric Activity dataset ([DogCentric](http://robotics.ait.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~yumi/db/first_dog.html)) [4] consists of first-person videos with outdoor scenes of wearable cameras mounted on dogs' back. 

### KSCGR

The Kitchen Scene Context based Gesture Recognition dataset ([KSCGR](http://www.murase.m.is.nagoya-u.ac.jp/KSCGR/)) [5] is a fine-grained kitchen action dataset released as a challenge in [ICPR 2012](http://www.icpr2012.org/).

### UCF-11 

UCF YouTube Action Dataset ([UCF-11](http://crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF_YouTube_Action.php)) [6] consists of videos that were manually collected from YouTube with a fixed resolution of 240x320 pixels. This dataset is very challenging due to large variations in camera motion, object appearance and pose, object scale, viewpoint, cluttered background, illumination conditions, etc.
